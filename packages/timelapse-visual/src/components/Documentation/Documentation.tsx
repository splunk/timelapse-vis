                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tips for Creating a Timelapse or Rangeslider
                    Dashboard
                </Heading>
                <P>
                    In order to create a timelapse or rangeslider compatible dashboard, your
                    dashboard should meet all of the following criteria:
                </P>

                <List type="decimal">
                    <List.Item>
                        <strong>
                            Dashboard permissions should be set appropriately.
                            <List type="decimal">
                                <List.Item>
                                    Your dashboard should be accessible by the user trying
                                    to view the timelapse.
                                </List.Item>
                                <List.Item>
                                    Your dashboard and any associated knowledge objects
                                    should be shared globally so that this app can read
                                    them.{' '}
                                </List.Item>
                            </List>
                        </strong>
                        &nbsp;For example, if you have a private dashboard it will not work
                        for all users.
                    </List.Item>
                    <List.Item>
                        <strong>All searches should have a valid _time field.</strong>
                    </List.Item>
                    <List.Item>
                        <strong>All searches should have _time in ascending order.</strong>
                        <br />
                        This can typically be completed by adding the following SPL to the
                        end of your search:
                        <br />
                        <i>| sort 0 + _time</i>
                    </List.Item>
                    <List.Item>
                        <strong>
                            All searches should return all iterations of the data that you
                            want to show-up in the timelapse or rangeslider.
                        </strong>
                        <br />
                        For example a single value for a regular dashboard might be based on
                        the following data:
                        <br />
                        <table>
                            <tbody>
                                <tr style={{ backgroundColor: '#36454e' }}>
                                    <td>count</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>15</td>
                                </tr>
                            </tbody>
                        </table>
                        <br />
                        For a single value in a timelapse or rangeslider, you'll want the
                        data to be structured more like this:
                        <br />
                        <table>
                            <tbody>
                                <tr style={{ backgroundColor: '#36454e' }}>
                                    <td>count</td>
                                    <td>_time</td>
                                </tr>

                                <tr>
                                    <td>15</td>
                                    <td>2020-12-12T00:00:00</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>

                                    <td>2021-12-12T00:00:00</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>22</td>
                                    <td>2022-12-12T00:00:00</td>
                                </tr>
                            </tbody>
                        </table>
                        <br />
                    </List.Item>
                    <List.Item>
                        <strong>
                            <strong>Performance Tip</strong> <br />
                            Proceed with caution when creating searches. If you have very
                            dense search results, your dashboard may not perform as well as
                            you want when using some visualizations
                        </strong>
                        <br />
                        For example, if you want to look at the latest values of each
                        country on a map, broken down into 15 minute increments, over 7
                        years - this will not perform as well as looking at the average
                        value for an entire year for each country over 7 years. You would be
                        scrubbing through 245280 search results for each country, versus 7
                        search results for each country.

                        <strong>
                            For searches with multiple-dimensions, every _time should have
                            values for all other dimmensions.
                        </strong>
                        <br />
                        For example a compatible single value might be based on the
                        following data:
                        <br />
                        <table>
                            <tbody>
                                <tr style={{ backgroundColor: '#36454e' }}>
                                    <td>count</td>
                                    <td>_time</td>
                                </tr>

                                <tr>
                                    <td>15</td>

                                <tr>

                                    <td>2021-12-12T00:00:00</td>

                        <br />
                        For something more complicated, like an SVG, you'll want to have all
                        iterations sorted in ascending order by _time:

                        Because timelapse and timerange visualizations are susceptible to

                        searches in your dashboard, and allow you to scrub through that
                        cached data. As a result, we currently do not support chain
                        searches.

                        If you only want to timelapse data from March 22nd through March
                        23rd, do not have your underlying searches searching through any
                        more data than that. This will force the timelapse to parse through
                        more data than it needs to, and result in performance degredation.
